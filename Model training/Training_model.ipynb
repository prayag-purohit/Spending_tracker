    "This notebook outlines a comprehensive approach to training a financial transaction categorization model using a pre-trained transformer model (distilbert-base-uncased). By leveraging **local processing** and privacy-focused techniques, the sensitive nature of bank transaction data is securely maintained. This method addresses class imbalance through oversampling and utilizes robust evaluation metrics to monitor performance.\n",

    "**Highlights**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sensitive Data Handling*: Utilizes local processing with Hugging Face libraries to ensure data privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pre-trained Model*: Uses distilbert-base-uncased, benefiting from transfer learning for better performance on limited data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Class Imbalance Handling*: Employs oversampling techniques to balance the dataset effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Error Tracking*: Logs model errors to monitor and enhance accuracy over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Small Dataset Size*: The initial dataset contains only 300 rows, which may limit the model’s generalizability. This is because of the sensitive nature of bank transaction data. Finding good-quality open-source data is tough. I tried data augmentation techniques but conventional augmentation techqniques do not work because of the uniqueness of the bank data. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Overfitting Risk*: With a small dataset and a powerful model, there is a high risk of overfitting. Implementing more regularization techniques and careful monitoring of training and validation loss will help mitigate this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can overcome these limitations by periodically retraining the model with new data, you can ensure that the model stays up-to-date with any new patterns or trends in your transactions."
